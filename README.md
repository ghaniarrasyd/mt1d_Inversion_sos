# Magnetotelluric 1-D Inversion using Symbiosis Organisms Organisms (SOS) Algorithm

This is my final research topic for my BSc degree. I used symbiosis organisms search (SOS) algorithm that mimics survival efforts of organisms in an ecosystem to invert 1-D magnetotelluric data. I also simulated the inversion processes using a modification algorithm of SOS.
